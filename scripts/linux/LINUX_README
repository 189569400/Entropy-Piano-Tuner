Follow these instructions to use the script build system to automatically build the code and publish it to the webserver.

1. Preparation
==============

These steps have to be done once. They are required for setting up your user build environment.

- Copy the file linux_env.template.sh to linux_env.user.sh and open it.
- Follow the instructions in the file to set up the paths correctly.
- Add the ssh key for the webserver to your keychain.

2. Build and publish
====================

Always repeat this steps if you want to publish a new version.

- cd to the scripts/linux
- run ./linuxPublish to build and publish the versions automatically to the webspace.

3. Hints (optional)
====================

You can also run each script called by linuxPublish.sh as single to only perform the desired action:

- ./linuxMake.sh to build the project (add a -c to clear before building)
- ./linuxCreateQtTranslations.sh to extract the translations from qt
- ./linuxCreateInstaller.sh to create the packages and the installer (add a -i to create only the installer but not the packages)
- ./linuxUpload.sh to upload the packages and installer to the webserver

4. Issues (optional)
====================

If you get ask for a passwort this means there is the ssh-key missing in your keychain for uploading to the webspace. Consider to add the ssh-key.
