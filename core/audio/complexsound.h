/// \brief Class for a complex sound
///
/// A complex sound is a tone with a spectrum containing many higher partials.
/// By defining a suitable spectrum one can generate different textures of
/// the sound. In the EPT, complex sounds are used to mimic the original sound
/// of the recorded piano key on the basis of the actually measured spectrum.
///
/// This class describes the spectral content of a complex sound. It does not
/// tell us anything about the dynamics (volume, duration envelope). This
/// will be accounted for in the class Synthesizer.
///
/// The playback of complex sounds is computationally expensive. Therefore, the
/// waveform is computed in advance: Whenever a sound is initialized, an
/// independent thread is automatically started which computes the waveform
/// and stores it locally in the member variable mWaveForm.
