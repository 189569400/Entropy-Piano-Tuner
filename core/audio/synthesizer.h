///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// \brief Class for a simple synthesizer based on Fourier modes.
///
/// This is a simple software synthesizer that can reproduce any
/// frequency spectrum.
///
/// A sound is produced in three steps. At first the sound has to be created
/// by calling the function CreateSound. Secondly one has to add one or several
/// Fourier modes with a given frequency and amplitude. This allows one to
/// create any sound texture. Finally, by calling the function PlaySound,
/// the waveform is calculated and sent to the actual audio implementation.
///
/// Each sound is identified by an ID, usually the number of the piano key.
///
/// The synthesizer supports basic ADSR-envelopes (attack-decay-sustain-release)
/// which are known from traditional synthesizers. The ADSR-envelope of each sound
/// (note) can be chosen individually. The release phase is triggered by calling
/// the function ReleaseSound.
