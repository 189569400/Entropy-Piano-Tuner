/// \brief Adapter class for reading an externally connected MIDI keyboard.
///
/// This abstract class defines the interface between the piano tuner
/// and an external MIDI keyboard. It has to be inherited in a specific
/// platform-dependent implementation (see class RtMidiImplementation).
///
/// A midi command consists of 3 bytes, as explained
/// e.g. in https://www.nyu.edu/classes/bello/FMT_files/9_MIDI_code.pdf
/// In addition, the callback function provides a parameter called 'deltatime',
/// which is basically the time in seconds elapsed since the last event.
